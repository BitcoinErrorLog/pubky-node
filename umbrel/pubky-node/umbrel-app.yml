name: Pubky Node
version: "0.2.0"
tagline: Sovereign identity infrastructure for the Pubky network
description: >-
  Run a full Pubky network node on your Umbrel. Pubky Node participates in the
  Mainline DHT — the largest P2P network on Earth with millions of nodes — and
  runs a Pkarr relay for publishing and resolving decentralized DNS records.


  Your node automatically attempts UPnP port forwarding for full DHT participation.
  If your router supports UPnP, no manual configuration is needed. Otherwise, the
  node runs in client mode which still supports all features.


  Features include a web dashboard with four tabs: Networks (real-time monitoring),
  Keys (Ed25519 key vault with QR import/export, identity watchlist, vanity key
  grinder), Homeserver (built-in Pubky homeserver with PostgreSQL backend, user
  management, Cloudflare tunnel, and admin API), and Explorer (look up any public
  key's DNS records from the DHT).
